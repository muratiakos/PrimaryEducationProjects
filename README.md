# Primary School Education tools - Project Archive
> This is an archive project collecation, unmaintained since 2003.

This repository is a science, math and literature demo and educational
software archive written in the early 2000s by me as a student.

The demonstration demo applications were maily written in Visual Basic 6
or Pascal for DOS and Windows.

For binary compilations, dependency and setup files, check releases.
